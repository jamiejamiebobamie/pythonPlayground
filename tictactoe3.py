# Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.
#
# You may assume the following rules:
#
# A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
# Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
# A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
# Example:
# Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
#
# TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);
#
# toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| | |
# | | | | // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
# | | | |
#
# toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | | | | // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
# | | | |
#
# toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | | | | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
# | | |X|
#
# toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | |O| | // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
# | | |X|
#
# toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | |O| | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
# |X| |X|
#
# toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# |O|O| | // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
# |X| |X|
#
# toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
# |X| |O|
# |O|O| | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
# |X|X|X|
# Follow up:
# Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?
#
# Hint:
#
# Could you trade extra space such that move() operation can be done in O(1)?
# You need two arrays: int rows[n], int cols[n], plus two variables: diagonal, anti_diagonal.

"""
no one cheats in this game so we don't need to keep track of if the move is valid
    only if there's a winner or if all squares have been filled.

the key insight is that we don't need to worry about a row, column, or diagonal the moment
    it contains both an X and O, because it can't be a winner. (must span 'n' to win.)

make bins out of all rows, columns, and  diagonals. ("bin" = dictionary)

each square has an i,j index.

rows have repeat i's
    (a row's key would be i)
columns have repeat j's
    (a column's key would be j)

          O X O X
          X O X X
          O X O O
          X O O O

     (0,0)(1,1)(2,2)(3,3)
     (0,3)(1,2)(2,1)(3,0)

            O X
            X O

    (0,0)(1,1)
    (0,1)(1,0)

     the indices of a diagonal either
     add up to equal n-1 (i + j == n - 1)
     or they equal each other (i == j)
     depending on whether it's going from
     left to right (i == j)
     or
     right to left (i + j == n - 1)
